## Introduction

Java provides a bunch of functional interfaces to deal with functional programming by using lambda and method references that comes under java.util.function package. Every predefined functional interface has its characteristics. 

>Some of the major ones are :
* Predicate
* Consumer
* Supplier 
* Function

## Predicate

* It accepts a single input.
* In other words, it is used for conditional checks.
* It supports a single abstract method named test().
* It always returns a Boolean type.

**For example :**
```java
import java.util.function.Predicate;

public class InBuiltFunctionalInterfaceExamples {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Predicate<Integer> ageTester = (x) -> x>18;
        if(ageTester.test(15))
        {
            System.out.println("You can vote");
        }
        else
        {

            System.out.println("You are too young");
        }
    }
}
```
**Output:**

```
You are too young
```
## Function

* It is used for performing logic on given input.
* It takes two arguments first is to represent input and second is for output.
* It supports a single abstract method named apply().
* Its return type can be varied.

**For example :**
```java
import java.util.function.Function;

public class InBuiltFunctionalInterfaceExamples {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Function<Integer,Integer> calculator = (x) -> 4*4;
        System.out.println("Square : "+calculator.apply(4));
    }
}
```
**Output:**

```
Square: 16
```
## Consumer

* It accepts a single input argument but returns nothing.
* It supports a single abstract method named accept().
* It doesnâ€™t have any return type.

**For example :**
```java
import java.util.function.Consumer;

public class InBuiltFunctionalInterfaceExamples {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Consumer<Integer> display = (x) -> System.out.println("I am displaying "+ x);
       display.accept(10);
    }
}
```
**Output:**

```
I am displaying 10
```
## Supplier

* It accepts no argument but returns a value.
* It must return something.
* It supports a single abstract method named get().

**For example :**
```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

public class InBuiltFunctionalInterfaceExamples {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Supplier<Date> date = () -> new Date();
        System.out.println("Date : "+date.get());

    }
}
```
**Output:**

```
Date : Thu Oct 21 13:56:32 GMT 2021
```
